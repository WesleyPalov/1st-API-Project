How we used the API was just to pull in the top 10 current headlines worldwide and allow the user to select a specific genre of news articles. Ranging from anywhere from worldwide to food. We built in a saving feature to our website that will keep the given headline, depsctiprtion, and link of the given data of any artcile.
